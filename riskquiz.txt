Weitz risk equation (as of 3/10/2020):
	e = 1 - (1 - pI)^n
	where:
		n = event size (# of persons)
		pI = I / (Pop);
				I = active circulating infections in US
				Pop = 330 * 10^6 (U.S. population estimate)

note: I must be adjusted from official count data to account for ascertainment bias. Common biases are 5 or 10.

This equation can be be adapted to a locality by replacing the population number and active case count with the locality's numbers

Mask Risk Reduction:

Risk reduction to the wearer seems to average around 65%

Outdoor Risk Reduction:

Numbers are slim but the Japan study has indoor rate of spread 18.7x higher than outside. Indoor risk is higher than outdoor. Outdoor risk seems to increase with event size, since people stand closer to hear each other speak.

Our potential risk assessment equation (Modified Weitz equation):

e = (1 - (1 - pI)^n) * (1 - m) * 1/O where:
	m = 0.65 (mask risk reduction to wearer rate)
	O = 18.7 * k (indoor risk reduction) (this number should go up with with more people @ event) 
					(Jacob: where k is dependent on the number of people present maybe every 10 or twenty people assumes 
					linear rate need to scale based on number of people somehow look at state limits for indoor gathering take 
					avg maybe)

questions:
	location? (Jacob: maybe make a predfined list assigning values to states based on case numbers, i think itd be hard to get much more
				specific then that)
	event size? (Jacob: get k from this size/(20/10) 20 for outdoors, 10 for indoors maybe just an idea)
	event inside/outside?
	mask wearing?
		mask wearing percentage?
	social distancing required?
		minimum distance?
	event duration? (Weitz assumes events of ~ 2.5hr (2-3hrs), maybe we can add a linear function centered around that)
				(Jacob: Yea not sure what to do with this )
	physical activity level? (bracketed? even possible to include?)
<<<<<<< HEAD
		(Jacob: maybe to much info to ask for, people comfortable sharing that? also I dont think phyical activity is what we should focus on
		  maybe just ask if they are at risk cause of any medical issues and then add a constant to their score if yes maybe base it on
		  severity of their issue (options: not-at-risk, mildly-at-risk, severly-at risk) something like that)

# TODO: review the above questions, feel free to restructure, add, remove, etc...
#		all that has to change in response is the structure of the quiz page 
#		and the encoding for the database. Note that we have an encryption scheme
#		and can probably store possibly sensitive data like location, etc.

# TODO: review the above equation, see if y'all are cool with it or if you feel any
#		modifications should be made...

# TODO: check out 'quizzard.js' in pages/ to see if y'all are cool with that way
# 		of structuring the quiz. Obviously it would look better than it does, but 
# 		a multi-page wizard form style in essence.

# My thoughts (Ben): I'm thinking that the quiz should maybe be restructured to 
# be based around the risk of a single event rather than an overarching number, 
# since that will allow us to give a more relevant and accurate number to users,
# who will be providing more information about their activities that way. This quiz 
# data can be saved and possibly searched (with autocompletion :) using fuzzy search algorithm
# overall, the user data will be more meaningful and useful.
